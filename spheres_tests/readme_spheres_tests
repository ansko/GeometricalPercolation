1) ./create_systems_pss.py - creates a set of systems containing 'spheres' that
    have percolation (results/geo/per) and that do not have percolation
    (results/geo/irreg). File names are n_(number_of_chains)_tau_(tau)_fi_(fi).geo.
    After that it might be useful to delete sime systems leaving just interesting,
    because meshing is a slow process.
2) Adjust list diluted_fis in dilute_fis.py. You may uncomment lines 56-57 to
    get sorted list of fi's. After that you can adjust list diluted_fis and
    uncomment lines 59-60. This will leave only files with desired fi's.
3) LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/anton/FEMFolder3/libs:/home/anton/FEMFolder3/my_libs
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ./create_meshes.py - creates .vol files for all structures from results/geo.
    It is good to make all meshes before running cluster culculations becuase in
    this case all mesehs are good.
    This run may take long time.
4) Run FEMmain.x on cluster with different input scripts.
